Problemas

PYTHONPATH doesn't work. On the server or on my machine




SAheart.yaml
TypeError: Cannot safely cast batch dtype float64 to space's dtype int64. 

I got this error when changing to using the file csv_dataset.py to do conversions





higgs.yaml

ValueError: VectorSpace(dim=1, dtype=float64) with total dimension 1 can't format a batch into VectorSpace(dim=2, dtype=float64)because its total dimension is 2

This happens when I set the softmax number of classes to 2. If I leave it 1 it runs but the cost function is (obviously) zero always.



wine.yaml (tutorial)
takes a loooooooooong time to finish (it is deep)
But it works and improves the target a lot.



arcus-1

ImportError: No module named pylearn2.utils

I suspect this is because I can't run setup.py. Should I just clone my installed version?
